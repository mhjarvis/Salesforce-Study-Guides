## Configuration and Setup

### Company Settings

#### Locale
Locale controls how different values are displayed (e.g. data dn time, address, currency, name, and number fields). The ```Company Information Page``` controls company-wide defaults and new users will use these default settings. However, users can OVERRIDE company default settings via ```Language and Time Zone settings``` in user's personal settings.

#### Language Settings
Language settings define the ```default language``` of the org and the languages the user will be able to use in their personal settings. There are 3 levels of language support: fully supported, end user, and platform languages. The default language is set on the Company Info page and applies to new users. The ```Translation Workbench``` allows translations to be applied to custom fields, labels, etc.
