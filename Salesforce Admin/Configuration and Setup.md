## Configuration and Setup

### Company Settings

#### Locale
Locale controls how different values are displayed (e.g. data dn time, address, currency, name, and number fields). The ```Company Information Page``` controls company-wide defaults and new users will use these default settings. However, users can override company default settings via ```Language and Time Zone settings``` in user's personal settings.
