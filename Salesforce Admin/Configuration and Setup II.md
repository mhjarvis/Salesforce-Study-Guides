# Configuration and Setup II

## UI Features

### UI Settings
There are two ways to set a default record page view at the org level:
* ```Full View``` - data-dense, focuses on details and related lists and puts all info on the same page.
* ```Group View``` - divides records info into groupings across multiple regions and tabs.

Found in ```Setup -> Record Page Settings```.

To ```override``` a default view, a ```custom``` Lightning record page can be created for a specified object and activated in ```Lightning App Builder```. Custom ```Lightning record pages``` can be activated selectively by Lightning app, record type, or profile.
