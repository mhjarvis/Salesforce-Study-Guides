# Setup and Maintenance of Users
Each Salesforce user has their own user record where personalized settings are established. The assigned profile determines their access to objects in addition to what privileges they have. On these user records, user licenses are assigned. Feature licences can be assigned for items such as Marketing, Knowledge, or Mobile User. Users are permanent records that ```cannot be deleted```. Instead, you can ```deactivate``` or ```freeze``` a user.

Key Words:
- User Details - last name, email, username, user license, and profile are required.
- User License - determines the level of access to the org and what profile can be selected for a particular user. 
- Feature License - provides access to additional features not included in a user license.
- Resetting Password - done by user or admin.
- Unlocking User Accounts - unlocked by admin.
- Localization - locale settings like language, time zone, and currency can be specified on a user's record.
